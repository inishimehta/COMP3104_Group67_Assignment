containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes),
and configuration management tools.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Implementing and understanding
the CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of testing and deploying code changes.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Learning the concept of treating
infrastructure as code, allowing for the automated provisioning
and management of infrastructure.

Monitoring and Logging: Implementing effective monitoring
and logging practices to ensure the health and performance
of applications and infrastructure.

Collaboration and Communication: Emphasizing the importance of collaboration
and communication between development and operations teams for seamless
integration and delivery.

Security in DevOps: Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline
to ensure the safety of applications and data.

Case Studies and Hands-On Projects: Applying theoretical knowledge through
hands-on projects and case studies to reinforce learning and develop practical skills.
