I enjoy reading sci-fi and adventurous books, and I'm always looking to discover 
new authors and series. Some of my favorite authors include Leigh Bardugo and Agatha Cristie.

I also enjoy watching shows in the same genre, with favorites like Passengers and Don't Look Up.

In addition to reading and watching, I'm passionate about coding and learning new programming 
languages. I'm currently exploring PHP, C#, Java and SQL. I find it exciting to learn new skills
and apply them to real-world projects.

Outside of academics, I love socializing with friends and trying out new cafes. 
There's something about exploring new places and trying new coffee flavors that 
I find really enjoyable. When I'm hanging out with friends, you can usually find us trying 
new cuisines at aesthetic cafes and playing board games.
